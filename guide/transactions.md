title: Transactions
---

A handy feature ist the transaction mechanism provided by the ```object_store```. Once an
object is inserted, updated or deleted the change is not reversible. If you use a transaction
it is. Therefor a transaction must be started:

```cpp
oos::object_store store;
store.attach<person>("person");

oos::transaction tr(store);

try {
  tr.begin();

  auto hans = store.insert(new person("Hans"));

  /// do some stuff and commit
  tr.commit();
} catch (std::exception &) {
  tr.rollback();
}
```

Once a transaction is started all changed are tracked until a ```commit``` is called. When it
comes to rollback a transaction ```roolback``` must be called (i.e an exception is thrown).
 
It is also possible to nest transaction:

```cpp
oos::transaction outer(store);

outer.begin();
// do something and start a second transaction

oos::transaction inner(store);
inner.begin();
// change stuff and commit inner transaction
inner.commit();
// commit outer
outer.commit();
```
